# Duet – SSH Pair Programming

SSH-first pair programming tool built with Go + Charm (Bubbletea/Wish).

## Features

- Create/join pairing sessions via `ssh duet.dev`
- Shared live terminal
- Real-time code review, chat, & collaboration
- Pure SSH – no browser, no setup

Inspired by terminal.shop, I wanted to build SSH UIs. I’ve also been wanting to learn Go for a while, so I decided to build this project over a weekend to both learn Go and build something useful.
